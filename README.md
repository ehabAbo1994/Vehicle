an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercise that helped me learn and practice OOP concepts.

    Instance variables and Methods, and Class level attributes
    Model systems with class inheritance i.e., inherit From Other Classes
    Parent Classes and Child Classes
    Extend the functionality of Parent Classes using Child class
    Object checking
